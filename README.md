## FUNwithPCA
Doing PCA from scratch (umm.... not really)

Here we have implmented PCA from scratch - did not implement Eigen Decomposition from scratch though.

<h4> We go through the following steps/concepts of PCA here :</h4>
- Scaling the data
- Getting the Covariance matrices
- Getting Eigen values 
- How to visualize results of PCA upto 3 dimensions. -> 3 principal components
- What does the notion of explained variances mean? -> what is the weightage of each pricipal component -> ratio of corresponding Eigen value with the other Eigne values this ratio will give the percentage of the data (variance) that is conserved along that axis
